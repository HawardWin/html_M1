            As we look at our surroundings, we see a large
variety of things with different shapes, sizes
and textures. Everything in this universe is
made up of material which scientists have
named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food
we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and
animals, even a small drop of water or a
particle of sand — every thing is matter. We
can also see as we look around that all the
things mentioned above occupy space and
have mass. In other words, they have both
mass* and volume**.
Since early times, human beings have
been trying to understand their surroundings.
Early Indian philosophers classified matter in
the form of five basic elements — the “Panch
Tatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.
According to them everything, living or nonliving, was made up of these five basic
elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had
arrived at a similar classification of matter.
Modern day scientists have evolved two
types of classification of matter based on their
physical properties and chemical nature.
In this chapter we shall learn about
matter based on its physical properties.
Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up
in subsequent chapters.

        Matter, a fundamental component of the universe, encompasses everything that occupies space and possesses mass. Early Indian philosophers categorized matter into five basic elements: air, earth, fire, sky, and water. This concept illustrates matter's ubiquitous nature, from the smallest particles to vast celestial bodies. Understanding matter is crucial for comprehending the world around us and its diverse forms and interactions. Therefore, defining matter is fundamental to our understanding of the universe.
